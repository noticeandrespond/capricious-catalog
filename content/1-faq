Hello Future is a culmination of Al Qasimi’s photographic, performance and film practice, unified within her keen focus on surface and texture, and the revealing visual influences of the splashy and florid. Farah is a bright and rising multidisciplinary artist whose work examines postcolonial structures of power, gender and aesthetic in the Persian Gulf states and global cultural confluence and migration at-large. The monograph includes an essay by Negar Azimi and conversation between Al Qasimi and artist Meriem Bennani.
The monograph is full color, 300 pages. Kiss-cut sticker dust jacket and mirror chrome hardcover with matching title bookmark. Designed by Studio Lin.
